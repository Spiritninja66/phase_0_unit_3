## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
git add lets you put your update or new file into something like a train station where the file 
will wait to be committed, or put into an actual train, where the changes will be saved onto
the internet.

#### branch

#### checkout
This allows you to look at 

#### clone
git clone allows you to clone a repository into a new directory.

#### commit
git commit is used to put your updates and files into your repository over the internet. This is when the
train leves the station. git commit -m"state status changes here"

#### fetch
This will allow you to download objects and refs from another repository.

#### log
git log works like a journal and list the time, author and changes made to the file.

#### merge
This will join two or more development histories together.

#### pull
git pull allows you to pull changes others may have made to the file.

#### push
git push tells GIT where to put out commits. git push -u origin master.

#### reset
 Reset current HEAD to the specified state

#### rm
git rm would remove files from the working tree and from the index.

#### status
This will show the working tree status.

## review
This all seemed pretty straight forward, but I feel I will get confused later on even with understanding
the basic commands. the locations of folders and updating them if everything is unorganized. I probably need to organize things more. Creating the folders and files within terminal might help. entering "git" into terminal is useful, it does give me the definitions of most of the commands needed. I just need more practice.
