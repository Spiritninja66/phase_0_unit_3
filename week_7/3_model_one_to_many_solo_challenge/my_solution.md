## Release 0: Users Fields
<!-- user_name, compose Tweet, follow -->

## Release 1: Tweet Fields
<!-- updated_at, created_at -->

## Release 2: Explain the relationship
The relationship between `users` and `tweets` is: 
<!-- each user name is displayed with their tweet. Other users are then able to favorite or repost the tweet. -->

## Release 3: Schema Design
<!-- Include your image (inline) of your schema -->

## Release 4: SQL Statements
<!-- Include your SQL Statements. How can you make markdown files show blocks of code? -->

## Release 5: Reflection
<!-- This challenge seemed simple. I just hope i grasped the concept behind understanding twitter 
and the way I represented it in my design. Twitter felt similar to facebook, except that twitter would focus more un just status updating.  -->
